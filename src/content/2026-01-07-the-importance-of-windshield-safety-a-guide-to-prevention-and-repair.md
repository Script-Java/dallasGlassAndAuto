# Introduction to Windshield Safety
Windshield safety is a critical aspect of vehicle maintenance, often overlooked until it's too late. Cracks, chips, and other forms of damage can compromise the structural integrity of your windshield, posing serious risks to you and your passengers.
## Why Windshield Safety Matters
* A damaged windshield can obstruct your view, leading to decreased reaction times and increased accident risk.
* The windshield provides up to 30% of the vehicle's structural strength, making it essential for withstanding roof crashes and other impacts.
* In the event of an accident, a intact windshield helps keep occupants inside the vehicle.
## Prevention is the Best Medicine
To avoid costly repairs and ensure your safety on the road, it's essential to address windshield damage promptly. Here are some prevention tips:
* Regularly inspect your windshield for signs of damage.
* Avoid extreme temperature changes, which can exacerbate existing damage.
* Use a windshield sunshade to reduce sun exposure.
